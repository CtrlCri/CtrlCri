# Hello! I'm Cristian
<p align="center"><img src="portada-linkedin-python.png" alt="portada"></p>

Professional software engineer for more than twenty years.

Since February 2022 I have been 100% dedicated to what I am passionate about: Web Development, Blockchain and Data Science.

I am currently developing web applications for digital artists and data science students. Excited about this collaboration that, at the same time, helps me apply my knowledge as a software engineer and programmer in a language as versatile as Python.
