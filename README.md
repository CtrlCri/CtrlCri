# Hello! I'm Cristian
<p align="center"><img src="portada-python.png" alt="portada"></p>

Professional software engineer for more than twenty years.

Since March 2022 I am also dedicated to my new passion: data science and artificial intelligence.

I am currently developing web applications for digital artists and data science students. Excited about this collaboration that, at the same time, helps me apply my knowledge as a software engineer and programmer in a language as versatile as Python.
